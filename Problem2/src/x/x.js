//Problem 2 
        // -write an api which gives the missing number in an array of integers starting from anywhereâ€¦.e.g [33, 34, 35, 37, 38]: 36 is missing
      //logic : sum of n consecutive numbers is [ n * (first + last) / 2  ]. 
     //so get sum of all numbers in array.
    // now take sum of n consecutive numbers.
   // n would be length+1 as 1 number is missing
